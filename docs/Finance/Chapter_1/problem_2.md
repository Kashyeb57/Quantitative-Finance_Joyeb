CAPM is used to calculate the expected return of an asset based on its systematic risk. 

Here is the formula:

$$
E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i (E(R_m) - R_f)
$$

Where:
* $E(R_i)$ = Expected return of the investment
* $R_f$ = Risk-free rate
* $\beta_i$ = Beta of the investment (measure of systematic risk)
* $E(R_m)$ = Expected return of the market
* $(E(R_m) - R_f)$ = Market risk premium
